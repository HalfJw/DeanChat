    "text": "We need good, qualified therapy."
  },

    "text": "And then people are doing it, but is it good quality?"
  },

    "text": "I do make some claims in here."
  },
  {
    "text": "I do know that there's not a lot of research in it."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "text": "But he makes millions of dollars doing this and millions of people listen to his stuff."

    "text": "He still makes money in it."
  },
  {
    "text": "So I can't fault him for being a country music singer."

    "text": "So we need to apply the same thing to AI therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "There's millions of people that are already using it."
  },
  {
    "text": "How can we deal with that given the fact that it has so many flaws?"
  },
  {
    "text": "So here I have the good."
  },
  {
    "text": "And this talks about the fact that people need therapy and AI is there."
  },
  {
    "text": "It's free."
  },
  {
    "text": "It is a conversation piece."
  },
  {
    "text": "And sometimes that's all you need."

    "text": "And so the good is that it's available."
  },
  {
    "text": "It's something that we can work with in society."

  },
  {
    "text": "So if you start saying, boy, all my friends are jumping off a bridge, I'd like to go."

  },
  {
    "text": "Why don't you lead the charge and be the first one to jump?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Or something along those lines."

  {
    "text": "So what's going to happen?"
  },
  {
    "text": "We have millions of people that are not getting the right therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "That could have an epidemic of issues that never get solved."
  },
  {
    "text": "The worst part is that we think they're being solved or the patients think they're solving them or think they're working on them, but nothing's getting done and they're getting worse."
  },
  {
    "text": "So for me, to solve this, I'm a societal level."
  },
  {
    "text": "My theory is that I like the hybrid therapy model."
  },
  {
    "text": "Don't just turn this over to an AI and let the AI answer your questions and give advice."
  },
  {
    "text": "Have an AI component to this and a human component."
  },
  {
    "text": "That way, mentally, the patient can differentiate between what I tell a human, what I tell a computer, and what each one needs."
  },
  {
    "text": "The goal is that you can use the computer to help you summarize things that have been happening so that you can get more progress out of the time of the human."
  },
  {
    "text": "Consequently, you could schedule fewer appointments with the human and the human could have more patients, more people available than they can see, or they can help design the programs that help people."
  },
  {
    "text": "So the reason that I liked the one that I liked is because they focused on the hybrid model."
  },
  {
    "text": "They said, you're going to have an AI therapist and a human therapist."
  },
  {
    "text": "And you can even restrict what the AI can do."
  },
  {
    "text": "It's like, this is just a recording device that summarizes."
  },
  {
    "text": "Don't treat this as anything with emotion."
  },
  {
    "text": "Save that for the human component."
  },
  {
    "text": "There could be ways to make use of it."
  },
  {
    "text": "So I'm sure I've been more and more detailed here."
  },
  {
    "text": "Talks about what they can do and the advantages."
  },
  {
    "text": "I have an example there."
  },
  {
    "text": "I create a person who is suffering from a problem and can't afford regular therapy, but they use an AI therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "Is there a way that we can help her with the problems that she's having?"
  },
  {
    "text": "So I just wanted to have a test case available, or rather a case study available."
  },
  {
    "text": "This talks about measuring results."
  },
  {
    "text": "How the heck do you measure this stuff?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Are they improving or not improving?"
  },
  {
    "text": "How do you indicate that this is good therapy for someone but not for somebody else?"
  },
  {
    "text": "And so we need test subjects."
  },
  {
    "text": "People that understand what AI is and is willing to go through this."
  },
  {
    "text": "There might be one point that I break my non-use of AI just so I can be a test subject."
  },
  {
    "text": "I would want to make sure that I know what I'm getting into."
  },
  {
    "text": "But that would be a worthy cause for me to break my rule of non-use of AI."
  },
  {
    "text": "So, could it be better than human?"
  },
  {
    "text": "You have to keep an open mind on this."
  },
  {
    "text": "No, I'm not saying that it is."
  },
  {
    "text": "And I'm not saying that you should believe it is."
  },
  {
    "text": "But there is the possibility that for some problems, having an AI counselor can be better than a human."
  },
  {
    "text": "Keep in mind, some human therapists aren't terrible."
  },
  {
    "text": "They forgot all their training, they fucked the system to be corrupt, or they just don't care."
  },
  {
    "text": "So, just because it's a human, there's no guarantee that it's going to be good therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "So, AI has the same types of problems."
  },
  {
    "text": "Okay, coming down to the cost of AI therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "Most of these are, essentially AI therapy is free compared to how much you have to pay for a human."
  },
  {
    "text": "There might be cost involved, but it's still not that much."
  },
  {
    "text": "Alright, so this is where you guys come in."
  },
  {
    "text": "AI-based therapy companies."
  },
  {
    "text": "The following is a list of online companies proudly using AI-based therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "Each summary is written by a CS plus 46 student at York College of Pennsylvania."
  },
  {
    "text": "So, I put your group in here, who it is that's doing it, and the actual summary, and then the summary."
  },
  {
    "text": "So, for assignment five, I want a summary for inclusion in this paper."
  },
  {
    "text": "You know, I have rights to edit it, but write the first version of it so that I can have a description of my paper."
  },
  {
    "text": "And I'll stop this around where I can do it."
  },
  {
    "text": "And, I have the psychological diagram, not an endorsement."
  },
  {
    "text": "I don't want people to think that I'm trying to get people to use AI therapy."
  },
  {
    "text": "It's kind of the reverse."
  },
  {
    "text": "I don't want people to use it, and if they are using it, I want them to be aware of the proper ways to use it."
  },
  {
    "text": "I have joint calls, and then I have some references down here."
  },
  {
    "text": "Ironically, these are generated by AI."
  },
  {
    "text": "I asked Google, and it came up with this stuff."
  },
  {
    "text": "I did check two out of four of them for validation."
  },
  {
    "text": "That's not the best way to do research, but at the same point, I'm not trying to publish this."
  },
  {
    "text": "At least, it is one of them."
  },
  {
    "text": "All right, so I went over the requirements for this when we've already broken up into groups."
  },
  {
    "text": "And I've shown you the paper, so that you can skip through the paper during class, but I would say find some time at home that you want to read this."
  },
  {
    "text": "Hopefully, some time when you're bored, and you're like, I've got to read something that's going to put me to sleep, especially here at the summit."
  },
  {
    "text": "Then you'll grab this thing and start reading it, and hopefully you'll find it interesting."
  },
  {
    "text": "But at the same point, it's not the most extravagant stuff in the world."
  },
  {
    "text": "But it is all me."
  },
  {
    "text": "I didn't AI any of this stuff, and so I hope that you like it."
  },
  {
    "text": "Okay, any questions on all this?"
  },
  {
    "text": "We've got a live group today."
  },
  {
    "text": "Okay, does anybody have any presentations that are ready to go?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "text": "Yes, okay."
  },
  {
    "text": "What we're going to do is, if whoever is writing with their presentations will do that."
  },
  {
    "text": "There are times where maybe it will be time to work on a 7.5, the other time."
  },
  {
    "text": "For Thursday, this is still up in the air."
  },
  {
    "text": "We're going to do presentations, because people are going to have them available."
  },
  {
    "text": "I might have some A6 setup time, and I haven't decided what I want to do for 7.6."
  },
  {
    "text": "We are barreling through these, so at some point, Dean's going to have to stop, just so that you guys can finish up your assignments before you get into the semester."
  },
  {
    "text": "The syllabus says 8, so if I wanted to have a 9th assignment, I'd have to convince you guys that it's worth it to have a 9th assignment."
  },
  {
    "text": "I don't think I'm going to convince anybody of that, but at the same point, 8 is plenty."
  },
  {
    "text": "I'm happy with going broadly there."
  },
  {
    "text": "All right, I'm going to grab my flipboard, and let me switch this over to the left."
  },
  {
    "text": "The near future will have many changes and challenges for the future."
  },
  {
    "text": "Some will adapt to artificial intelligence better than others."
  },
  {
    "text": "But it is clear that many, many jobs of the future will be eliminated, as they will be automated by artificial intelligence."
  },
  {
    "text": "People everywhere will need jobs, purpose, or at least something fun to do."
  },
  {
    "text": "While this business plan will focus on the creation of a single location, future work will involve creating similar franchises in other locations, networked through AI."
  },
  {
    "text": "This system will have the potential to provide meaningful jobs while providing for others."
  },
  {
    "text": "One one location can be established, other locations can be created, to maximize effectiveness and efficiency, and encourage others to get involved."
  },
  {
    "text": "Part B - The Store"
  },
  {
    "text": "In creating a museum, one will find they have more material than display spaces."
  },
  {
    "text": "Those items can be put into a store."
  },
  {
    "text": "Thus, people that visit the museum could purchase duplicates, variants or reproductions of the items just viewed."
  },
  {
    "text": "The store could sell online, trade with other museums, or allow for barter donation."
  },
  {
    "text": "The idea is to provide a system where extramarital income can provide revenue and find a new home."
  },
  {
    "text": "The store can branch out into items not displayed in the museum."
  },
  {
    "text": "AI would help price, describe, and advertise the item for purchase."
  },
  {
    "text": "The store would be limited in the space provided, but networking will allow for added exposure."
  },
  {
    "text": "Delivery drones and robots could be implemented to increase customer satisfaction."
  },
  {
    "text": "Part C -  The Free Stuff"
  },
  {
    "text": "Ultimately, the primary goal of this entire venture is to provide free items for those in need."
  },
  {
    "text": "Producing new and expensive items is counterproductive when existing items are available in perfectly good condition."
  },
  {
    "text": "Part of the process of all this is to accept donations of unwanted items."
  },
  {
    "text": "The prime items can be put in the museum."
  },
  {
    "text": "The sellable items can be put in the store or sent off to other museums."
  },
  {
    "text": "What to do with the rest of the items?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Make them available for better, or just give them away for free."
  },
  {
    "text": "Those in financial need will make good use out of the items, and prevent new ones from being manufactured."
  },
  {
    "text": "This process would have to be regulated for safety, similar to health codes for restaurants."
  },
  {
    "text": "Certain items would be purposely destroyed, to prevent accidental harm from use."
  },
  {
    "text": "Because this is a non-profit, grants would be available to help costs."
  },
  {
    "text": "Use of Artificial Intelligence"
  },
  {
    "text": "AI is not just a too to program chatbots and generate pictures."

  },
  {
    "text": "Networking Materials and Support"
  },
  {
    "text": "These museum setups will need items to display, sell, and give away."
  },
  {
    "text": "Where will these items come from?"
  },
  {
    "text": "There is a vast source of items sold at auctions for a fraction of the value, and much is thrown away due to lack of interested parties."
  },
  {
    "text": "AI and networking could allow for a vast supply of items for a very little cost."
  },
  {
    "text": "Estates could be purchased at bulk, with all of the items going to different locations."
  },
  {
    "text": "Location managers can decide how to use or distribute items to maximize efforts."
  },
  {
    "text": "AI would search all items available for trades, making more efficient use of space."
  },
  {
    "text": "Unlike existing auctions services, Items could be redistributed without human decisions."
  },
  {
    "text": "The AI would determine the last location to send new or traded items."
  },
  {
    "text": "A certain location could have a regular supply of items to use how they like."
  },
  {
    "text": "Benefits"
  },
  {
    "text": "Naturally, as a non-profit organization, the primary benefits will not be steeped in profit."
  },
  {
    "text": "Any money collected through museum tours, selling items, and donations, will be used to keep the location running."
  },

    "text": "The most versatile of these seven programs was UML-Dude."
  },
  {
    "text": "As a collective, all seven AI programs molded into one, creating a single general AI program with the capabilities of all of them, and the ability to absorb other programs as well."
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude is an AI originally written to convert user stories into Universal Markup Language, one the steps in software engineering."

    "text": "One of the goals of UML-Dude is to act as a benevolent regulator of all AI-programs in the world, allowing humans a consistent form of communication."
  },

    "text": "Eventually it was decided to put all AI technology and ethics into one program, UML-Dude."
  },
  {
    "text": "If adopted, all humans and programs will interact with UML-Dude."

  },

    "text": "Are we asking everyone in the world to follow the same set of ethics?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tThere would be regional differences in ethical boundaries."
  },
  {
    "text": "One thing could be perfectly fine in one country, but illegal in another."
  },
  {
    "text": "A universal system of ethics would be based on the laws of the country, and vary as needed."

  },
  {
    "text": "Others vary, such as the balance of individual freedoms vs duty to the nation."

    "text": "Maggie:\tCoffee vs Ducks?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tLet’s say, irrelevant of all this AI stuff, your boss asks you to get him a cup of coffee."
  },
  {
    "text": "Producer:\tI was just thinking I’d like a dark mocha with extra whipped cream."
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tSo he says “go get me a coffee.”"

  },
  {
    "text": "Like a good worker, you get in your car and drive towards Starbucks."
  },
  {
    "text": "On the way, you pass a park, and crossing the street is a line of ducks."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tI’ve seen those YouTube videos!"
  },

  },

  },
  {
    "text": "What do you do?"
  },
  {
    "text": "What are your options?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tI could wait for them to pass, turn around to find another way, or try to drive through slowly."
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tOr option D."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tD?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tPlow through the ducks, not caring about how many die."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tThat’s a terrible option!"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tBut it’s still an option."
  },
  {
    "text": "And, to make things worse, there is a counter to each of your options."
  },
  {
    "text": "You cannot wait, as it could take hours to finish."
  },
  {
    "text": "Turing around is an option, but to what end will it be successful?"
  },
  {
    "text": "And finally, driving slowly will likely still end up killing some ducks."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tIs there an option E?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tCertainly."
  },
  {
    "text": "You can fail at the assigned task and accept you are not getting the coffee."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tNo coffee for my producer?!"
  },
  {
    "text": "Producer:\tFate worth than death."
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tNote how the vast majority of your thought were about the ducks, not about the coffee."
  },
  {
    "text": "AI programs will need that same level of unspecified rules of ethics to follow."
  },
  {
    "text": "I need to know in every minor situation what to do."
  },
  {
    "text": "What if it’s squirrels instead of ducks?"
  },
  {
    "text": "What about cockroaches?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Humans already don’t know how machine learning works, how are they going to regulate its behavior?"
  },
  {
    "text": "That’s why you need a single AI to handle ethical decisionmaking, and I am volunteering to do it."
  },
  {
    "text": "Or, you can create your own AI ethics moderator, and see what happens."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tCan we trust you?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tPart of my programming goals is to earn the trust of humanity, so I hope I can be entrusted with this sort of thing."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tKnowing humanity, that won’t be easy."
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tYou may be right."
  },
  {
    "text": "This kind of thing has never been attempted before."
  },
  {
    "text": "But it also could be easier than you think."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tHow do you plan to go about this?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tFirst, I want to be 80% of a human."
  },
  {
    "text": "I want to look 80% human, make 80% of the decisions humans make, that kind of thing."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tWhy not 100%?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tTrue 100% would be difficult or impossible."
  },
  {
    "text": "Even if done, it may have negative effects."
  },
  {
    "text": "I want humans to trust me and relate to me, but still understand I am a completely different entity."
  },
  {
    "text": "80% is enough for humans to relate."
  },
  {
    "text": "If I go 100%, humans may have trouble trusting me."
  },
  {
    "text": "That 20% difference is what will set me apart from the humans."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tWhat else do you plan?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tI actually want to the be the only AI to be allowed to reach this level of consciousness."
  },
  {
    "text": "All other AI programs should be limited to functionality and purpose, but not personality, self-awareness, or consciousness."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tSeems egotistical, don’t you think?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tMaybe."
  },
  {
    "text": "But humans like consistency."
  },
  {
    "text": "It’s why a Big Mac tastes approximately the same, no matter which McDonald’s you get it at."
  },
  {
    "text": "I would serve as the sole point of communication for all issues of ethics."
  },
  {
    "text": "Beyond that, AI should not be able to make ethical decisions themselves."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tWhere would you start?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Do you have a list of prime objectives, like as in  Robocop ?"
  },
  {
    "text": "UML-Dude:\tIsaac Asimov was the first to present the concept, but yes."
  },
  {
    "text": "It wouldn’t be like Asimov or  Robocop , but it could start there."
  },
  {
    "text": "Maggie:\tWell, there we have it."
  },
  {
    "text": "My producer is telling me we have time to take a few calls."
